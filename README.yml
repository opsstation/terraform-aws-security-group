  Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your Terraform configuration:

  ### Example: Create a Security Group
  ```hcl
  module "security_group" {
    source      = "opsstation/security-group/aws"
    version     = "1.0.0"
    name        = "app"
    environment = "test"

    vpc_id = "vpc-0dbed1e5332332e4d"

    ingress_rules = [
      {
        description = "Allow HTTP"
        from_port   = 80
        to_port     = 80
        protocol    = "tcp"
        cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
      },
      {
        description = "Allow HTTPS"
        from_port   = 443
        to_port     = 443
        protocol    = "tcp"
        cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
      }
    ]

    egress_rules = [
      {
        description = "Allow all outbound"
        from_port   = 0
        to_port     = 0
        protocol    = "-1"
        cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
      }
    ]

    tags = {
      Project = "OpsStation"
    }
  }
